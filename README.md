## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game asks you to enter a number between **1 and 10**.
2. If the number is in the correct range, the game prints:
   - Square  
   - Cube  
   - 4th power  
   - 5th power  
   - … all the way to the 10th power  
3. After displaying the results, the game asks if you'd like to play again.
4. If you type **yes**, the game restarts.  
   If you type **no**, the game ends.
